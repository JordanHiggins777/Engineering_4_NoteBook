<summary>Python Assignments</summary>
<details>
<summary>Hello PI</summary>

## Objective: 
Power up my Rasperry PI then wrtie a program that spits out "Hello World!" 10 times.
## Prossess:
Given this was the first assignment of the year, the actual prossess of writing the code and powering on my Pi were very simple given Dr.Sheilds had given a step by step tutorial(LINK: https://youtu.be/FFUm7omFLUE) on how to do the assignment. Just follow this step by step and youll be done assuming no technecal errors.
## Code Explanation: 
All this assignment is, is 2 lines of code
```
for i in range(0,10):          ## this sets the amount of times the loop runs for in this case it's 10 times.
	print("Hello, World!")      ##this prints any statment in the quotations.
```
## Problems and Solutions:
#### Problem 1: 
Your PI does not turn on
#### Solution 1:
Turn it off and on again. If that does not work you may have a fualty pi especially if your PI starts to heat up.
#### Problem 2:
The 2 lines of code simply do not work
#### Solution 2:
Check to make sure its a ".py" file, check that your pi led is on, and check for any misspellings in the code.

## Reflection: 
While this assignment is by far the simplest it may have taken the most time out of any. With the transition to at home engineering and the fact Ive never used a raspberry PI didnt help.

<summary>Get the Pi online</summary>
            
## Objective: 
Make a Engineering 4 notebook in GitHub.
## Prossess:
This was another assignment that was provided a youtube video as a resorce(LINK:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IpcrxeftwE&feature=emb_title).Getting the PI online was a bit difficult for me personaly because of my pi disintegrating the SD cards it came in contact with, thus I had to get a new PI in person and that was a prossess in itself because this is 2020 and getting sheadules to match up is a nightmare. regardless i eventually got the new PI online and a engineering 4 notebook up. The hardest part of the actual assignment was this one glitch where it didnt reconize my account, I just shoutdown the pi and tried again. My guess is this just came down to a typo error. Other then that i had no problems.
## Code Explanation:
N/A whoops no code.
## Problems and Solutions:
#### Problem 1:
My pi disintegrating the SD cards it came in contact with
#### Solution 1: 
Get a new PI

#### Problem 2:
The .conf command does not reconize your account
#### Solution 2: 
Restart from the begining it was probly a typing error(It was for me)

## Reflection:
Given you are reading this I did eventually get this assignment done. This was a easy assignment that wouldve taken ~ one day to complete in different senario, hopefully in the near future 2020 quarantine will be over.
